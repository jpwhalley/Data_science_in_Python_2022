## Day 4: Neural networks in Python

Carrying on from yesterday, we will look to use the feature-rich, gene expression data to practise classification using neural networks. Can we accurately classify the samples to the experimental conditions based on their gene expression?

Using the follow neural networks:

+ Dense layers, no loss
+ Dense layers, with loss
+ Convolutional layer with loss
