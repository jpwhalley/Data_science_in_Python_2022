# Data Science in Python
## Day 2: Working with data in Python

Having got the data, it is the moment to begin getting our hands dirty with data analysis. We will study two packages: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the fundamental numeric computing and linear algebra package in Python, that allows for decent data analysis. We will learn it not only for the data analysis, but more importantly because it will be a package that will be always present in our `import` section as scientists. After NumPy we will go to [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Pandas is a dedicated data analysis package with a lot more functionalities than NumPy, making our life much easier in terms of data visualization and manipulation.

## Machine learning in Python

On a small dataset we will go through the typical pipeline of a real Machine Learning project: start with statistical summaries and visualization of the data, build multiple different machine learning models, use cross-validation to estimate their accuracies, select the best algorithm, make and evaluate the predictions on a validation set. 
At the end of the session, we might have a look at the other useful functions integrated into scikit-learn
